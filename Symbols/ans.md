In this challenge, we are given an image of math symbols, from the first couple of symbols and the flag format, we can guess that the flag is the initials of these symbols in LATEX.

By using Mathpix Snip, a tool that can convert images into
LaTeX for inline equations, we can get most of the
symbols and get the flag.

```
```latex
{ \Pi \ltimes \aleph y \_ \wp \infty \therefore \heartsuit \_
\Lsh \aleph \Theta \eth \Xi \}
```
